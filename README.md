# NLPlay-with-Transformers
-----------
The first phase of the project was to use Natural Language Processing for Sentiment Analysis. We were given resources to gain the basic knowledge about Machine learning required for the project in week 1. First we used simple Feed Forward Neural Networks using Bag Of words and then in week 3 we modified that model by using RNN and then later LSTM and GRU.

--------
# Week 1
------
1. Learned the basics of Python.
2. Covered basic libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib and pytorch.
3. Learned how Neural Networks work.
4. Covered the theory of how NLP works and the different steps in it
5. Covered the basic codes of nltk.
6. Introduction to Github and Google Colab.

------
# Week 2
------
1. Went deeper into Natural Language Processing.
2. Learned about Word Embeddings.
3. Created a Sentiment Classifier using Feed Forward NEural Network.

**Creating a Neural Network for classifying positive and negative reviews trained on the IMDB dataset of 50,000 reviews.**
1. Saved the csv file on github and downloaded it on colab.
2. Completed word tokenization.
3. Removed stopwords.
4. Completed Stemming.
5. Divided file into 70% training and 30% testing.
6. Used BOW vectorization.
7. Implemented a Feed forward NN with 2 hidden layers of 500 neurons each.
8. Used ReLu as activation function and cross entropy for loss function.
9. Used Stochastic Gradient Descent with different batch sizes and learning rates.
10. Maximum accuracy achieved: 87.87%
