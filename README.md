The first phase of the project was to use Natural Language Processing for Sentiment Analysis. We were given resources to gain the basic knowledge about Machine learning required for the project in week 1. First we used simple Feed Forward Neural Networks using Bag Of words and then in week 3 we modified that model by using RNN and then later LSTM and GRU.
